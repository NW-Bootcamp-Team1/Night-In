          I am an aspiring developer who pivoted into the tech industry in 2021. While working in fintech
          support, I discovered that I am a fast learner with an interest in developing programming skills. I
          have done a fair amount of self-learning via Codecademy and Udemy and have decided to make the
          commitment to this bootcamp. My knowledge of HTML and CSS have already helped incredibly with
          certain issues I need to troubleshoot at work, and I'm excited to absorb even more knowledge.

          I live in Chicago with my wife Jessica, and our two cats, Luna and Milo. We have lived here since
          2017 and are happy to call Chicago home. I am obsessed with urban sketching, amphibians of all
          shapes and sizes, and trivia (just don't ask me about sports). A fun fact about me is that my brain
          is 95% Lizzie McGuire Movie references.
